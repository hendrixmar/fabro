"""Deterministic engine for the Fabro code-review workflow.

Review agents return validated JSON in their final messages. Fabro passes those
results to deterministic merge commands over standard input. This program owns
state transitions after Fabro's native agent retries, plus normalization, caps,
deduplication, verdict arithmetic, coverage records, and the canonical result
bundle.

Every tier above low projects one rule-mapped structure: a grouping pass
assigns every target file to exactly one local-correctness job, whole-change
angles cover cross-cutting concerns, path-matched YAML rules produce their
own audit jobs, and (at xhigh/max) a coverage-aware gap-fill sweep runs
last; fresh sweep candidates are verified the same way. The tiers differ
only in deterministic dials: grouping fidelity (semantic agent vs lexical
chunks), rule layers (full built-in library vs repository rules plus the
repository-instructions pack), caps, verification bias, the sweep, and the
model reasoning effort the graph's stylesheet selects. The low tier keeps
the original single-pass shape from the Claude Code local /code-review
workflow: one hunk-only finder, no verification, no rules. Deterministic
code decides what merges, what survives, and what the report can claim.

Python 3.9-compatible. Standard library only, except that rule compilation
(every tier above low) imports rule_loader, which requires the pinned
PyYAML dependency; the low tier never imports it.
